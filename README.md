# NetworkIncidentAnalysis Project

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p> Welcome to my Network Incident Analysis Google Cybersecurity Certificate Portfolio Project! In this project, I've analyzed a network incident using the National Institute of Standards and Technology's Cybersecurity Framework (NIST CSF). The goal was to demonstrate my ability to identify, analyze, and respond to cybersecurity incidents within an organization.</p>

<h2> Scenario </h2>
<p>In this activity, I was tasked with creating an incident report based on a scenario provided by the course. The scenario involved a distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack on a multimedia company's internal network.<br>
The multimedia company experienced a DDoS attack that compromised their internal network for two hours. The attack flooded the network with ICMP packets, causing a disruption in network services. The incident management team responded by blocking incoming ICMP packets and implementing various security measures to prevent future attacks.
